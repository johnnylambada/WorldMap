WorldMap is a simple Android app that displays a map of the world taken from Wikimedia (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Physical_Political_World_Map.jpg), and allows the user to scroll around on it. Note the map is from wikipedia and licensed as public domain (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Physical_Political_World_Map.jpg).

The map itself is quite large (6480,3888), so it's way too big to fit in memory all at once (6480 x 3888 x 16 / 8) = 50,388,480 -- over 48 megs. The VM heap size Android supports is eith 16 or 24 megs, so we can't fit the whole thing in memory at once.

So WorldMap uses the BitmapRegionDecoder API (available as of API 10) to decode just what it needs to display.

120410-initial The initial version is quite dumb. It's able to track
               the user, but it decodes the entire bitmap each time,
               making the user experience quite choppy. About 4fps.

120411-cached  This is much faster, average case of about 20fps. With
               this version I read in 50% more picture in each direction
               whenever I need to read.  Played with this against the
               "largest image in wikipedia"
               http://boingboing.net/2010/11/09/biggest-image-on-wik.html
               It's a 25mb jpg weighing in at 27184,16995 px! I was able
               to scroll all the way across and down the image with no
               problems. Uncompressed, this file would take up
               27184*16995*16/8 bytes (881 megs) of memory.

Road Map
--------
* Add flinging to move quickly across the map

* Work on getting the frame rate up
  * Perhaps use SurfaceView
  * Or glSurfaceView

* backport BitmapRegionDecoder to 2.2 or use a different library with JNI.
  * on SO, Dianne Hackborn says this is non trivial.

* Add zooming to infinite levels
  * start with the map fully unzoomed
  * Calculate where in the world we are once we get to a certain level, then create an intent to start Google Maps.
